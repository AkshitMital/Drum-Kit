# Drum Kit Webpage

Welcome to the Drum Kit Webpage! This interactive webpage allows you to play virtual drums by either clicking on the drum pads or using your keyboard. It's a fun and engaging way to create your own beats and rhythms. This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it's a great example of how these technologies can come together to create an interactive user experience.
